# IT-140--Introduction-To-Scripting

# Purpose of this course
Teaches fundamental programming concepts using the Python language. Students learn to develop simple scripts and build useful applications through two projects, including a text-based game. The course emphasizes computational thinking and the use of industry-relevant tools and best practices.

# What I did
- Designed a storyboard and pseudocode or a flowchart for a text-based game.
- Developed the actual code for the text-based game using an IDE (PyCharm).

# What I learned
Learned the fundamentals of programming, which includes core concepts like data types, variables, decision statements (if/else), loops (for/while), functions, and file handling.

# Reflection
I had a lot of fun. I considered making a habit of creating games and other applications as a career as well. Here is where I truly got a start in coding and understanding language concepts (starting with Python).
